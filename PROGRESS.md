## 📋 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE ESTABLISHED

### **Service Layer Pattern (Proven & Tested):**
```python
# REQUEST FLOW ESTABLISHED:
HTTP Request → Router Validation → Service Logic → Agent Processing → Database Persistence → HTTP Response

# PATTERN REPLICATION FOR OTHER AGENTS:
1. Create [agent]_service.py with load/process/save methods
2. Create routers/[agent].py with HTTP endpoints  
3. Add [agent]-specific schemas for validation
4. Test via interactive documentation
5. Verify database persistence and state management
```

### **Data Flow Mastery:**
**State Reconstruction:** Database columns → agent-expected dictionaries
**Conversation Persistence:** HTTP request → database session → conversation continuity
**Format Translation:** Web JSON ↔ Agent Python objects ↔ Database models
**Session Management:** UUID tracking across multiple stateless requests
